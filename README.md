## 📂 Projects
### 1️⃣ Detection of malaria by using blood cell images
**Description:** Developed a machine learning model to detect malaria by analyzing blood smear images. Leveraged convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing infected and non-infected cells. Preprocessed data using techniques like image augmentation to enhance model robustness. Utilized Python libraries such as TensorFlow and OpenCV for model implementation and visualization. This project demonstrates the application of AI in healthcare for rapid and reliable disease diagnosis. 
- 🛠️ Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas,TensorFlow, Keras,Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
- 🚀 Features: Automated classification of blood cells as malaria-infected or healthy.
Utilized image pre-processing techniques to enhance dataset quality.
Integrated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate image recognition.
Designed to be scalable and deployable for real-world healthcare applications. 

### 2️⃣ [Clustering Analysis](https://github.com/Akshata3815/Clustering_Analysis)
**Description:** Conducted a clustering analysis to uncover hidden patterns and group similarities within datasets. The goal was to segment data into meaningful clusters for enhanced decision-making and actionable insights. 
- 🛠️ Tools: 
Programming Languages: Python, R
Libraries: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Visualization Tools: Tableau, Power BI
Development Environments: Jupyter Notebook, RStudio
